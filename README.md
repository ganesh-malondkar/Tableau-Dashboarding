Use of Tableau Dashboard and Story to provide in-depth analysis and visualisation from business point of view 

## Dataset
Flight Dataset from Latin America consisting of 3 original sheets - User, Flight Bookings and Hotel Bookings
## Objective
As a Travel Agency, understand the distribution of bookings and find critical information that potentially saves travel costs for client companies

## Story
#### [Funds Lost](https://public.tableau.com/views/Flight-FundsLost/FundsLost?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Every flight booking has a combination of 3 Airlines and 3 Passenger Classes for each route put together

As a booking executive, trying to understand how this choice affects the travel costs is explained in a Story created using Level Of Detail Calculations and Heatmap
## Executive Summary
The flight dataset reveals an even distribution amongst most parameters 

There is a difference in ticket prices for same route and same class booked through different Airlines

The flight booking agency can save a lot of money over the years if maximum tickets are booked by the agency proving lowest ticket price on the given route

Users of different companies travel to few select locations as visualized on geospatial data dashboard
